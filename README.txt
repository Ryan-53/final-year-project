The 'cnn_prediction_system' directory contains a simple tkinter python app
showcasing the model.

The dataset_generation_example_scripts directory showcases the scripts used to
automated the generation of images for the dataset. NOTE: These will not work
without the specialist image generation software that was used during the
project.

The training_workbook directory contains the jupyter notebook used for the
building and training of the CNN model. NOTE: This requires a high performance
GPU to run (this was done using Google Colab during the project).
